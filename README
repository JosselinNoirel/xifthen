This package implements new commands to go within the first argument of
\ifthenelse to test whether a string is void or not, if a command is
defined or equivalent to another. It includes also the possibility to make
use of the complex expressions introduced by the package calc, together
with the ability of defining new commands to handle complex tests. This
package requires the e-TEX features.
